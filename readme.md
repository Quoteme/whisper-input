# whisper-input

Transcribe your voice to text using Openai whishper.
This is just a very simple python script packaged using NIX for maximum ease of use.
Just run the following command, wait for a notification to tell your to start speaking and start speaking.

```bash
nix run github:quoteme/whisper-input
```

Once you are done, stop speaking. A new notification will pop up, informing you that the transcription is complete
and your spoken text will be written to whatever text field you are currently editing.
